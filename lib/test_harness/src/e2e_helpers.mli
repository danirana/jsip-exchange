(** A test client: an open RPC connection to the server. A future revision
    (once the session-feed RPC and login flow exist) will extend this with a
    buffered session feed so [rpc_submit] can return the events produced by
    the just-submitted request. *)

(** [connect_as ~port participant] connects to the running exchange server on
    [port], authenticates via [login_rpc], and subscribes to the persistent
    [session_feed_rpc] channel. Spawns a concurrent background worker that
    flushes all received execution events directly to stdout, prefixed with
    [[participant]] for seamless tracking within multi-client expect tests. *)

    (audit log subscriptions, second clients on the same connection, etc.). *)

(** Submit an order via RPC. The RPC is one-way: this returns once the server
    has enqueued the request. Participant-targeted events (acceptance, fills,
    rejection) are currently printed on the server's stdout via the
    dispatcher's session stub. *)
